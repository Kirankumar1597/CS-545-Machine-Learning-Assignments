# CS-545-Machine-Learning-Assignments
The first assignment deals with the creation of appropriate functions for the three-layer neural network using python coding.
The second assignment deals with the creation of the neural network class using python coding.
The third assignment deals with the creation of neural network classifier by inheriting the neural network class created in the second assignment using python coding.
The fourth assignment deals with the creation of convolutional neural network model by inheriting both the neural network class and neural network classifier created in the second and third assignment using python coding
The fifth assignment deals with reinforcement learning to move the marble to a specified goal position by duplicating the classes with few changes used in the lecture Reinforcement Learning Modular Framework using python coding.
